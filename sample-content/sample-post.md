# Why Astro?

Astro is a modern web framework that pulls your content from anywhere and serves it fast. It is great for personal websites and blogs because it generates static HTML by default, which is perfect for SEO and performance.

## Material Design 3 Principles

Material Design 3 (also known as Material You) is Google's latest design system. It focuses on:

1. **Accessibility**: High contrast and readable typography.
2. **Personalization**: Dynamic color systems.
3. **Adaptive Layouts**: Content that fits any screen.

### Code Example

Here is a simple example of how you might define a component in Astro:

```astro
---
const { name } = Astro.props;
---
<div>
  <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
</div>
```

## Conclusion

Building with Astro and MD3 gives you a professional, developer-focused aesthetic that is also highly performant.
